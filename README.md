# Movies
# A fully functional example project written in Swift showing to display movies’ list in staggered view with a feature to search within a list


• This Project is developed with MVVM architectural pattern
• Test cases are written from ViewModel to show case Mock objects creation and how protocol oriented programming makes it easy to create low/weak coupling and results in scalable, maintainable code.
• Search feature uses existing list and can be easily tweaked for fetching from REST API if needed.

Assumptions: 
• Back button in the landing page is only for display as we assume from the title that movies are displayed according to genre. However Back button from search functionality takes user back to movies’s list from genre.
